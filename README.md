# SML Unicode Library

This library makes it possible to process unicode stored in
[UTF8](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8) format.

## Using the library

Just refer to the `unicode.mlb` file in your SML project. Then you can
use the structures `Utf8` and `UnicodeChars`. The `Utf8` structure
provides basic operations for processing UTF8 files. The
`UnicodeChars` structure provides bindings for a series of useful
unicode characters.

## More information

For information about UTF8, consult [the wikipedia entry on
UTF8](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8).
